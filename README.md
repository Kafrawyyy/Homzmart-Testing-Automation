# Homzmart Web Testing with Cypress

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains my final project for the QA Testing Internship, where I developed a comprehensive suite of automated end-to-end tests for the Homzmart website using **Cypress**. The project is designed to validate critical functionalities across various user interactions, ensuring a seamless and reliable shopping experience.
